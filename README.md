# Portfolio

My personal portfolio.

## About the project

This is version 2.0 of my portfolio. This one was created following a video series on YouTube. 2.0 is almost an exact replica, I will be adding on top of this for some time before releasing another version.

The information on the portfolio at the time of it's creation is all falsified. That will be the first update after creating a contact form.

## Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- SCSS
- JavaScript

## Roadmap

These are the future plans for this project.

1. add real information, projects, images, etc.
2. add contact form (to keep my email and phone off of the public web as much as possible)

## Known issues

1. menu image should be completely opaque, not partially transparent as background
2. make sure all work and other grid images are the same size or at least the same proportion
3. contact page does not shrink well (this will not really matter as I will change it to a functional contact form)
