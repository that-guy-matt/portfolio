# Portfolio

My personal portfolio.

## General info

This is a quick portfolio that I threw together to satisfy the requirements for FreeCodeCamps first portfolio. It's nothing to look at as of the time of writing this README. This project will be updated on occasion to reflect my updated skillset.

## Built with

* HTML
* Bootstrap
* CSS
* SCSS

## Project Status

Unfinished. This is still a work in progress and probably always will be as I intend to keep it updated.
